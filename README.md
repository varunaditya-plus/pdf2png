# pdf2png

pdf2png is a **homebrew package**, to turn pdfs into pngs.

I build this because for some reason there either isn't a CLI pdf to png tool that works for me,</br>
or I'm just too dumb to use them.

<h2>✐ Notes</h2>
I have never made a homebrew project before, and I probably messed something up with this one. I made it to be super simple so anyone can use it, but I wrote half of it from copy pasting from the Homebrew Docs, and the other half is from ChatGPT (and the other half of actual python is mine).
